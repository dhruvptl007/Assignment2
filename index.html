    <h3>I found a love, for me</h3>

    <p>Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
      Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
      Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
    <p>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
      Not knowing what it was<br>
      I will not give you up this time<br>
      But darling, just kiss me slow<br>
      Your heart is all I own<br>
      And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
    <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
      With you between my arms<br>
      Barefoot on the grass<br>
      Listening to our favourite song<br>
      When you said you looked a mess<br>
      I whispered underneath my breath<br>
      But you heard it<br>
      Darling, you look perfect tonight<br></p>
    <p>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
      She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
      I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
      To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
    <p>We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
      Fighting against all odds<br>
      I know we'll be alright this time<br>
      Darling, just hold my hand<br>
      Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
      I see my future in your eyes<br></p>
    <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
      With you between my arms<br>
      Barefoot on the grass<br>
      Listening to our favorite song<br>
      When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
      I don't deserve this<br>
      Darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
    <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
      With you between my arms<br>
      Barefoot on the grass<br>
      Listening to our favorite song<br>
      I have faith in what I see<br>
      Now I know I have met an angel in person<br>
      And she looks perfect<br></p>
    <p>I don't deserve this<br>
      You look perfect tonight</p>
